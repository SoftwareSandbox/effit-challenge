# PHUC IT - The Game

## Abbreviation
`PHUC IT` stands for: `P`eter `H`as `U`s `C`ompeting `I`n `T`reachery

## Rules
The purpose of the game is collect the most points by Friday evening when the _Last Ledger_ is held and a ranking is made.

Points are collected by fulfilling assigments, after you fullfill an assignment you have to yell: `PHUC IT!!`.
Failing to announce you've completed an assignment with PHUC IT will collect no points.
 
At least one other player has to be present to acknowledge the completed assignment. 

A player can steal the point from a completed assignment by yelling `Steal!` right after the player claimed the finished assignment.
It is allowed to steal a "Steal". All claims (PHUC IT and Steals have to be made directly (2-3 seconds) when the assignment is finished and when a witness is present.

Players can double the earned points by wearing our custom ski mask (doggo balaclava) while performing the assignment. 
If a player steals the points of an assignment with double the points, the points get split between the first 2 players. 

Points can be stolen from the first thief, but not from the player that fulfilled the double points assignment.
The player that tried to use the double while the points were stolen, gets to keep his multiplier however.

Disputes will be discussed during the _Ledger phase_. The _Ledger phase_ starts right before dinner.

Assignments can be linked/combo'd. A steal then only affects the assignment with the highest points.
